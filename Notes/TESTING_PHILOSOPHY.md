# Testing Philosophy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing philosophy and practices for the Net Worth Tracker application. Our testing approach focuses on ensuring reliability, maintainability, and confidence in our codebase.

## Testing Principles

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Write tests before implementing new features
- Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Tests should drive the design of our code

### 2. Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage (target > 80%)
- Focus on critical business logic and user interactions
- Prioritize testing of data operations and calculations

### 3. Test Types

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies (localStorage, DOM)
- Focus on pure functions and data transformations
- Location: `tests/unit/`

#### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flow between modules
- Test event handling and state management
- Location: `tests/integration/`

#### UI Tests
- Test user interactions and DOM updates
- Verify visual feedback and state changes
- Test form submissions and validations
- Location: `tests/ui/`

### 4. Test Structure

#### Data Service Tests
- Test all CRUD operations
- Verify data persistence
- Test error handling
- Test data validation
- Location: `tests/unit/dataService.test.js`

#### UI Component Tests
- Test component initialization
- Test event handlers
- Test DOM updates
- Test user interactions
- Location: `tests/ui/`

### 5. Testing Guidelines

#### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `*.test.js`
- Test suites: `describe('Component/Feature Name')`
- Test cases: `test('should do something specific')`

#### Test Organization
```javascript
describe('Component Name', () => {
    // Setup
    beforeEach(() => {
        // Common setup code
    });

    // Test cases
    test('should handle specific case', () => {
        // Arrange
        // Act
        // Assert
    });
});
```

#### Mocking Guidelines
- Mock external dependencies consistently
- Use Jest's built-in mocking capabilities
- Document mock behavior
- Example:
```javascript
jest.mock('chart.js', () => ({
    Chart: jest.fn(),
    registerables: []
}));
```

### 6. Continuous Testing

#### Pre-commit Hooks
- Run tests before each commit
- Prevent commits if tests fail
- Run linting and formatting checks

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- Run all tests on pull requests
- Run tests on deployment
- Generate coverage reports

### 7. Test Maintenance

#### When to Update Tests
- When adding new features
- When fixing bugs
- When refactoring code
- When changing business logic

#### Test Review Process
- Review tests with code changes
- Ensure test coverage is maintained
- Verify test quality and readability

### 8. Testing Tools

#### Primary Tools
- Jest: Test runner and assertion library
- jsdom: DOM environment for testing
- Chart.js mocks: For chart-related tests

#### Additional Tools
- Jest Coverage: For coverage reporting
- ESLint: For code quality
- Prettier: For code formatting

## Running Tests

### Local Development
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### CI/CD
```bash
# Run tests in CI environment
npm ci
npm test
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**
   - Each test should be independent
   - Clean up after each test
   - Don't rely on test order

2. **Readability**
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Add comments for complex scenarios

3. **Maintainability**
   - Keep tests DRY
   - Use helper functions for common setup
   - Update tests with code changes

4. **Performance**
   - Keep tests fast
   - Use appropriate mocks
   - Avoid unnecessary DOM operations

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Test Coupling**
   - Avoid tests depending on each other
   - Don't share state between tests

2. **Implementation Details**
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Avoid brittle tests
   - Focus on public APIs

3. **Mocking Overuse**
   - Don't mock everything
   - Use real implementations when possible
   - Mock only external dependencies

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Testing**
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Test large datasets
   - Monitor render times

2. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Add a11y tests
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Verify screen reader compatibility

3. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Add cross-browser tests
   - Test responsive design
   - Verify feature support
